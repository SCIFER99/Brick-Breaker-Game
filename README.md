# Brick-Breaker-Game
This is another game developed in Python.

Greetings all! I have another challenge! 

Here we have a brick breaker game set up, but there is something wrong.
The ball is not moving? Why is it not moving? 

This is challenge I leave to the Python community. :-)

Packages needed:

    pip install pygame
    pip install time
    
Happy Coding!
